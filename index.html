                    My name is Brandon Gee I was born and raised in Philadelphia, and I want to change the world. I love tech,
                    skateboarding, animals, people, and my family. In the near future I plan to use my mind, heart and technology to
                    improve the quality of life for everyone. I believe there are enough resources for us all to live comfortably. If we
                    all work together I truly believe we can live in harmony and eradicate violence and poverty. I have a ton of ideas
                    constantly swirling through my mind and I am trying to get them out as fast as I can. Take a look at some of these
                    creations on the portfolio page!
